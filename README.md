## Scope

The **Sponsored Data** API enables a sponsoring company to cover the data usage of end users for a defined period and/or data volume, thereby strengthening its brand presence and enhancing the user experience.

The API is organized into three hierarchical levels:

- **Sponsor:** The company that finances the sponsored data usage.  
- **Campaigns:** Sets of sponsorship actions contracted by sponsors for various commercial or marketing purposes.  
- **Sponsored Subscribers:** Individual users participating in a campaign, who opt in to receive sponsored data for a defined volume and duration. The sponsorship is always activated upon the user’s explicit choice or consent.  

Campaigns can follow one of two commercial models:

Campaigns can be organized under different commercial models, depending on the sponsorship agreement between the Sponsor and the Operator:

- **Prepaid** — The Sponsor pre-purchases a total data volume, from which units are deducted as sponsored sessions are started and consumed.  
- **Postpaid** — The Sponsor is billed at the end of the campaign cycle based on the actual sponsored data consumption.

The API supports the following operations:

- `/start-sponsorship`  
- `/session-status`  
- `/revoke-sponsorship`  
- `/campaign-status`  
- `/active-sponsorships`  
- `/configure-alerts`  
- `/campaign-management`

Identifiers such as **Sponsor_Id**, **Campaign_ID** and **Session_ID** are generated and managed by the Operator Platform (MNO).
